# System Design

A simple and practical collection of **Low Level Design (LLD)** concepts with real-world examples, design patterns, SOLID principles, UML diagrams, and working code implementations.

## 🎯 What's Inside

- ✅ **Design Patterns** with real code examples
- ✅ **SOLID Principles** explained with practical scenarios  
- ✅ **UML Diagrams** for visual understanding
- ✅ **Real-life problem solutions** 
- ✅ **Working code implementations** in multiple languages
- ✅ **Interview preparation** focused content

## 🔧 Design Patterns Covered

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** - Database connection, Logger
- **Factory Method** - Payment processing, Vehicle creation
- **Abstract Factory** - UI components for different platforms
- **Builder** - Complex object construction (Pizza, Computer)
- **Prototype** - Object cloning scenarios

### Structural Patterns  
- **Adapter** - Third-party API integration
- **Decorator** - Adding features to existing objects
- **Facade** - Simplifying complex subsystems
- **Composite** - File system, Organization hierarchy
- **Proxy** - Caching, Access control

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer** - Event handling, Notification system
- **Strategy** - Payment methods, Sorting algorithms
- **Command** - Undo/Redo functionality, Remote controls
- **State** - Vending machine, Order status
- **Template Method** - Data processing pipelines

## 🏗️ SOLID Principles

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class should have only one reason to change
- Examples: User management, Email service separation

### O - Open/Closed Principle  
- Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
- Examples: Shape drawing, Discount calculation

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- Examples: Bird hierarchy, Vehicle inheritance

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
- Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- Examples: Printer interfaces, Worker roles

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Examples: Database abstraction, Service injection
