# **Drawbacks Summary - Tightly Coupled System**

## **Core Problems:**

1. **❌ Rigid Design** - Can't add/remove components without modifying core class
2. **❌ Hard to Test** - Dependencies can't be mocked/stubbed
3. **❌ Violates SOLID Principles** - Breaks Single Responsibility & Open/Closed
4. **❌ No Flexibility** - All users get same behavior, no customization
5. **❌ Poor Scalability** - Adding features makes code unmaintainable

## **Real Impact:**

- **Maintenance Nightmare** - Every change requires modifying working code
- **Testing Impossible** - Can't isolate components for unit testing
- **No Reusability** - Components can't be used elsewhere independently
- **Runtime Inflexibility** - Can't adapt to different user needs/scenarios

## **The Fix: Observer Pattern**
**Decouple with:**
- Publisher (subject) that doesn't know about subscribers
- Subscribers (observers) that register interest
- Runtime subscription management

**Result:** Components can plug-in/out without modifying core system.
